# The Mission
The Department of Environmental Conservation, from New York City, has recently made the news by telling the people that they needed their help. Indeed, their request is simple: They needed the people of New York City, whether young or old, to go to the nearest tree in their street and gather information about that tree. This is all in an effort to make the population aware that nature is important, even in big Metropolis like NYC. Now that they have heard back from the people, the DEC noticed that they missed a crucial step. They forgot to give the people a data collection guide, and so the data they received back is a bit messy.

Can you help them clean the data so that they can begin to raise awareness to ecological issues, such as climate change ?

----Requirement for dataset----
- Can values be consolidated? (e.g. Truck and truck refer to the same thing)
- Are there some columns where most of the data is missing ?
- Can you fill in some missing values ?
- Is the date format correct?
- Are some values integers that should be float or vice-versa ? Change the dtype.
